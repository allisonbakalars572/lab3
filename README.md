# Allison's Web Walking Tour
This library shows a map-based guided tour, delivered through a browser that highlights various peaceful parks around Lake Mendota. These files were created as a part of lab 3 for an advanced cartography course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for students with little to no programming experience, and beginner HTML/CSS skills. My files are based on code from my instructor here: https://github.com/cartobaldrica/web-walking-tour.
